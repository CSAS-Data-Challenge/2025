# Files

The scripts in this repo are to read the pitch swing data in `arrow`
format into Julia, Python, or R. They assume that the arrow dataset
has been downloaded to the same folder.

The arrow dataset need to be downloaded from the Kaggle competition
site at
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csas-2025-data-challenge>.

For those who are interested, `preparrow.R` is an R script that reads
in the original CSV file and writes out the arrow dataset.
